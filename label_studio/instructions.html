<div><span class="highlight">NOTE:</span> Label studio prevents links from automatically opening in a new tab/window, use right-click  “Open in new tab” to open the linked PDFs if needed.</div></br>

<div>This is just a small overview of the labels, for more detailed instructions (including navigating the interface) you can download the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/a-rios/ad-generation/master/pdfs/AD_annotation_guidelines.pdf" >annotation guidelines as PDF</a>.</div></br>

<div>To help with character identification, see these lists with <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/a-rios/ad-generation/master/pdfs/Characters_de.pdf">characters in the German movies</a> and this list with <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/a-rios/ad-generation/master/pdfs/Characters_it.pdf">characters in the Italian movies</a> (data for both from IMDB).</div></br>

<div>One of the German movies, <i>8 Tage im August</i>, contains occasional dialogue snippets in English. Those are not considered for this task (the models did not have access to the audio).</div></br>
<div>Additionally, the timing of the descriptions is not part of the evaluation, the models use the same timings as the original descriptions created by the audio describer.</div></br>
